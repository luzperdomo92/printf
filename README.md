				Project _printf

The _printf function is used to display a formatted string. An escape character "%",
to specify the relative location and the type of output depending on the next letter,
knows that the function should produce.

The formating options: s, d, c, i, b, o, u.

for example:

    _printf("the letter is %c\n", A);

    output: the letter is A.

(the "\n" is for jump line.)

With two formating

     _printf("the letter is %c and the number is %d\n", A, 1);

     output: the letter is A and the number is 1.

(the "\n" is for jump line.)
